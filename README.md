### Hello! 
- My name is Roro and I'm an aspiring software engineer.
- Recently, I've been learning programming, and I am starting my first year of university next year.
- I'm currently learning coding mostly in C.
- Funfact about me is that I love art! I find it really fun to create something meaningful from a blank canvas with endless possibilities. 
I find coding to be somewhat the same, so I'm looking forward to learning more.
- If you got this far, thank you for reading!
